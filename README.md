# DesktopCat
Small cat sprite made using WPF that will chase the mouse.

How to use and what it does

- when cursor is close enough will start to chase mouse 
- once caught cursor it will wander round with it until eventually letting go (usually less than 60 seconds)
- to close app press Alt-A, this will also release cursor if caught 

Known Bugs
